    pc: `Ah, my trusty PC. I've spent countless hours problem-solving and coding at this workstation. 
         From Python to C/C++ to Ruby, it's witnessed the growth and evolution of my skills as a developer. 
         It's currently open to 
         <a href="https://github.com/meprz" target="_blank">my GitHub page</a>.`,

    "cs-degree": `As I near the completion of my studies, this is where I'll proudly display my degree 
                  in both Computer Science and Mathematical Sciences. My journey towards earning this 
                  has been filled with late-night study sessions, challenging classwork, and 
                  many moments of breakthrough and satisfaction.`,

    "sofa-table": `I can't forget to take breaks! Sometimes, the best ideas come to me when I'm relaxing 
                   on this sofa. It's important to step away from the computer screen and give my mind a 
                   chance to recharge.`,

    tv: `Movies have always been a favorite hobby of mine, and this TV has been 
         a window into many interesting stories. My favorite film of last year was 
         <a href="https://youtu.be/VvSrHIX5a-0?si=TEdM2hO7664kpune" target="_blank">Godzilla Minus One</a>. 
         It's a masterpiece!`,

    bed: `My bed -- it looks so warm and cozy! Investing in a quality mattress has been one of the best 
          decisions I've made for my sleep and overall well-being. It has made a world of difference in 
          the quality of my rest.`,

    resume: `On my desk sits my 
             <a href="https://github.com/meprz/resume/blob/main/Miguel_E_Perez_Resume_No_Num.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a>. 
             Crafting a strong resume is an art in itself. It's not just about listing experiences and skills. 
             It's about presenting a compelling narrative that showcases my unique value.`,

    projects: `This interactive portfolio was built using the Kaboom.js library, a powerful tool for creating 
               games and interactive experiences with JavaScript. What's interesting is that the text you're 
               currently reading is rendered using HTML and CSS, separate from the game canvas itself! If 
               you're curious to learn more about Kaboom.js and how to create your own interactive projects, 
               I highly recommend checking out 
               <a href="https://youtube.com/@jslegenddev" target="_blank">JSLegendDev</a> on YouTube.`,

    library: `As a child, I was an avid reader. However, nowadays, finding the time to sit down and read 
              is difficult. Most of this bookshelf is filled with reference guides and handbooks. 
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel)" target="_blank">The Three-Body Problem</a> 
              is one of the few exceptions. Its spine is creased from my having recently re-read it 
              in anticipation of the upcoming Netflix adaptation.`,
